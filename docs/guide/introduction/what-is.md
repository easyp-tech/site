## Simplify Your Protobuf Development

EasyP accelerates development, ensures consistency across your protobuf files, and provides a convenient mechanism for
managing protobuf packages.
By automating tedious tasks and catching potential errors, EasyP reduces the risk of production breaks and ensures a
smoother development experience.

## Decentralized Package Management

Unlike other tools, EasyP doesn't rely on a centralized server for package distribution.
Instead, any Git repository can serve as a package source, giving you more flexibility and control over your
dependencies.
This approach eliminates vendor lock-in and makes it easier to manage your protobuf packages.

## Seamless Migration from Buf

EasyP is fully backward compatible with Buf settings, ensuring a smooth transition from Buf to EasyP.
You can easily switch to EasyP without worrying about compatibility issues or reconfiguring your setup.

## Key Features

- **Linting**

  Catch errors and inconsistencies in your protobuf files with EasyP's built-in linter.

- **Package Management**

  Easily manage and distribute protobuf packages using EasyP's decentralized package manager.

- **Generator**

  Generate protobuf code with ease using EasyP's code generator.

- **Breaking Changes Checking**

  Ensure that your API changes don't break backward compatibility with EasyP's built-in checker.

By using EasyP, you can focus on developing your application without worrying about the complexities of working with protobuf.
